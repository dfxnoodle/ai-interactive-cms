# AI Interactive CMS - Codex CLI Integration Summary

## Understanding OpenAI Codex CLI

After reviewing the official OpenAI Codex documentation at https://github.com/openai/codex, here's the correct understanding:

### What Codex CLI Actually Is

**Codex CLI is a terminal-based AI coding assistant** that:
- Works directly with your codebase and files
- Operates in an interactive terminal environment
- Can read, modify, and create files in your project
- Executes commands and runs code safely in a sandbox
- Integrates with your development workflow (git, package managers, etc.)

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install via npm (NOT pip)
npm install -g @openai/codex

# Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Test installation
codex --help
```

### Basic Usage Patterns

#### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Start interactive session
codex

# Start with initial prompt
codex "explain this codebase to me"
```

#### Non-Interactive Mode
```bash
# Quiet mode for automation
codex -q "fix lint errors"

# With JSON output
codex -q --json "explain utils.ts"
```

#### Approval Modes
- `suggest` (default) - Shows suggestions, requires approval
- `auto-edit` - Automatically applies file edits, asks for shell commands
- `full-auto` - Fully automatic (network-disabled, sandboxed)

### Key Features

1. **File Operations**: Can read, write, and modify files in your project
2. **Shell Command Execution**: Can run terminal commands (safely sandboxed)
3. **Git Integration**: Understands git repositories and can create PRs
4. **Package Management**: Can install dependencies, run tests, etc.
5. **Multi-modal**: Can process screenshots and diagrams
6. **Project Understanding**: Uses AGENTS.md files for project context

### How Our CMS Integrates

Our AI Interactive CMS provides a web interface that:

1. **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional communication
2. **Command Proxy**: Forwards user prompts to Codex CLI via shell execution
3. **Output Streaming**: Captures and displays Codex CLI output in the browser
4. **Workspace Management**: Allows users to specify working directories
5. **Multiple Command Types**: 
   - `ai_chat`: Natural language prompts passed to Codex
   - `codex`: Direct Codex CLI commands
   - `shell`: Regular shell commands

### Security Considerations

Codex CLI includes built-in security features:
- **Sandboxing**: Network-disabled execution on supported platforms
- **Directory Limiting**: Restricts file access to working directory
- **Git Integration**: Warns when working outside git repositories
- **Approval Modes**: User can control automation level

### Example Prompts for Our CMS

#### Code Generation
- "Create a Python FastAPI endpoint for user authentication"
- "Add TypeScript types to this JavaScript file"
- "Generate unit tests for the utils module"

#### Code Analysis
- "Explain this algorithm and its time complexity"
- "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"
- "Suggest optimizations for this database query"

#### Project Operations
- "Fix all linting errors in the project"
- "Update package.json dependencies to latest versions"
- "Create a comprehensive README for this project"

### Configuration Options

Users can configure Codex via:
- `~/.codex/config.yaml` or `~/.codex/config.json`
- Environment variables
- Command-line flags
- Project-specific `AGENTS.md` files

### Integration Architecture

```
Browser Client
    ↓ WebSocket
FastAPI Server (Our CMS)
    ↓ Shell Execution
Codex CLI Process
    ↓ API Calls
OpenAI API
```

This architecture allows us to provide a web-based interface to the powerful Codex CLI while maintaining all its safety features and capabilities.

## Updated Implementation Notes

1. **Simplified Commands**: Use `codex -q "prompt"` for non-interactive execution
2. **No Custom Providers**: Codex CLI handles API configuration internally
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Check for API key configuration and installation
4. **Workspace Awareness**: Always run Codex in the correct working directory
5. **Output Parsing**: Handle both stdout and stderr appropriately

The corrected implementation in our main.py now properly integrates with the real Codex CLI as documented by OpenAI.
